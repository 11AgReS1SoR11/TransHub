## Commit Guidelines

For example:

## Branch Naming Convention

```
For example:

```

## Pull Request Naming Convention

The title of the Pull Request (PR) should include the TASK_ID in square brackets. For example:

```
## Asking Questions

You can ask questions in PRs, but they should be marked with [question] {the question itself}. For example:
```
[question] Why do we need variable x here?
```

After answering a question in a thread, the initiator of the question should close the thread.

## Review and Feedback

Feedback and suggestions are welcome on PRs. Each comment or suggestion should be addressed or explained why it's not applicable. Once you have made the necessary changes in response to feedback, you should resolve the thread.

## Approval Process

PRs can only be merged after all threads are closed, and at least 2 approvals have been given by code owners.

## Code Owners
